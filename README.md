# Simple JavaFX Template

This is a simple template for creating JavaFX projects.

## Features
```
1. Api Call Class
2. Window Class (Modularize window creation)
3. Base Controller (Used for repeated actions) 
```

## Usage

Currently, small modifications might need to be made such as file paths.
Base Controller Class must extend to Child Controller Classes.
I would suggest keeping the directory structure.
